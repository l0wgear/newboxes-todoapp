# Todo App for newboxes

## Project description

This is a front end note taking web app built with React and TailwindCSS. It offers basic todo functionality, such as:

- Creating and editing todos
- Different priorities and status types
- Setting for optional todo date with overdue indication
- Synchronisation with Google Calendar (currently limited to test users only, as the service has not been verified by Google)

## Live demo

The app can be tested live at [Github Pages](https://l0wgear.github.io/newboxes-todoapp/)
